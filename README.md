# This is the Compose world that belongs to the kitties

## 🙌 Description
A Compose Kitty App sample with exquisite ui and animation effects.


## 🌟 Motivation and Context
Although many people use material design to complete their works very well, I prefer to try other different styles!
And I am very interested in exploring various APIs of Jetpack Compose, so it was created.

## 🐱 Note

Although it is already cool from the screenshots and screen recordings, it is actually an unfinished work. Due to time issues, I will optimize and complete this project in my spare time (because some parts of the current The code is really bad!)
In addition, I will integrate it with [TheCatApi](https://thecatapi.com/) and a series of popular libraries to complete the function of discovering cats, and more...
Finally, 猫猫什么的，我最喜欢了！
